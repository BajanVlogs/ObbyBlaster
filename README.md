# ObbyBlaster

Ever wanted to have a cannon plugin? Well, now you can with the all-new ObbyBlaster! Blast through bases like never beforeâ€”just place obsidian on the ground with a button on the back of it, then place some TNT on top, smack the button, and get to raiding.

**New Features:**
- Dispenser cannons added with button direction.
- Updated with the latest API.

Hope you enjoy this plugin as much as I enjoyed making it!
